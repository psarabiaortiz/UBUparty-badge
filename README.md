# UBUparty-badge
This repository contains the pcb badge done for the event UBUparty 2019.

The objective was to make a PCB badge compatible with Microbit Edge connector, hackeable and good looking.

The process to design the badge take a couple of days and its quite simple, just by uusing the KiCAD tool Bitmap to component converter, an image is set in the front and in the back a standard prototyping layout was set so any of the participants could design and implement its own circuit.
